/*
Which of the following is true about a concrete subclass? (Choose all that apply)

A. A concrete subclass can be declared as abstract.
B. A concrete subclass must implement all inherited abstract methods.
C. A concrete subclass must implement all methods defined in an inherited interface.
D. A concrete subclass cannot be marked as final.
E. Abstract methods cannot be overridden by a concrete subclass.

B. Concrete classes are, by definition, not abstract, so option A is incorrect. A concrete class must implement all
inherited abstract methods, so option B is correct. Option C is incorrect; a superclass may have already implemented an
inherited interface, so the concrete subclass would not need to implement the method. Concrete classes can be both final
and not final , so option D is incorrect. Finally, abstract methods must be overridden by a concrete subclass, so option
E is incorrect.
