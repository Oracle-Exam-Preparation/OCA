Which code can be inserted to have the code print 2?

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BirdSeed seed = new BirdSeed();
        System.out.println(seed.numberBags);
    } }

A. Replace line 1 with BirdSeed(2);
B. Replace line 2 with BirdSeed(2);
C. Replace line 1 with new BirdSeed(2);
D. Replace line 2 with new BirdSeed(2);
E. Replace line 1 with this(2);
F. Replace line 2 with this(2);

E. Options A and B will not compile because constructors cannot be called without new. Options C and D will compile but
will create a new object rather than setting the fields in this one. Option F will not compile because this() must be the
first line of a constructor. Option E is correct.
