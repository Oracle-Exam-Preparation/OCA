What is the output of the following code snippet?

3: int x = 0;
4: String s = null;
5: if(x == s) System.out.println("Success");
6: else System.out.println("Failure");
A. Success
B. Failure
C. The code will not compile because of line 4.
D. The code will not compile because of line 5.

D. The variable x is an int and s is a reference to a String object. The two data types are incomparable because neither
variable can be converted to the other variableâ€™s type. The compiler error occurs on line 5 when the comparison is
attempted, so the answer is option D.
