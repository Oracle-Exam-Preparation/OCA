Which are methods using JavaBeans naming conventions for accessors and mutators? (Choose all that apply)
A. public boolean getCanSwim() { return canSwim;}
B. public boolean canSwim() { return numberWings;}
C. public int getNumWings() { return numberWings;}
D. public int numWings() return numberWings;}
E. public void setCanSwim(boolean b){ canSwim = b; }

C, E. Option A is incorrect because the property is of type boolean and getters must begin with is for booleans. Options
B and D are incorrect because they donâ€™t follow the naming convention of beginning with get / is / set . Options C and E
follow normal getter and setter conventions.
