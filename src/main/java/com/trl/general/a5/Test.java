Which of the following are true statements? (Choose all that apply)

A. Java allows operator overloading.
B. Java code compiled on Windows can run on Linux.
C. Java has pointers to specific locations in memory.
D. Java is a procedural language.
E. Java is an object-oriented language.
F. Java is a functional programming language.

B, E. C++ has operator overloading and pointers. Java made a point of not having either. Java does have references to
objects, but these are pointing to an object that can move around in memory. Option B is correct because Java is platform
independent. Option E is correct because Java is object oriented. While it does support some parts of functional
programming, these occur within a class.
