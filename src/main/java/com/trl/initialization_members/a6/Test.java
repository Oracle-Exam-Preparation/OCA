Which of the following lines of code compile? (Choose all that apply)

A. int i1 = 1_234;
B. double d1 = 1_234_.0;
C. double d2 = 1_234._0;
D. double d3 = 1_234.0_;
E. double d4 = 1_234.0;
F. None of the above.

A, E. Underscores are allowed as long as they are directly between two other digits. This means options A and E are
correct. Options B and C are incorrect because the underscore is adjacent to the decimal point. Option D is incorrect
because the underscore is the last character.
