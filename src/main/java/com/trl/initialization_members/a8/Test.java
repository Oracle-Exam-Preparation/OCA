/*
What data type (or types) will allow the following code snippet to compile? (Choose all that apply)

byte x = 5;
byte y = 10;
_____ z = x + y;

A. int
B. long
C. boolean
D. double
E. short
F. byte

A, B, D. The value x + y is automatically promoted to int , so int and data types that can be promoted automatically
from int will work. Options A, B, D are such data types. Option C will not work because boolean is not a numeric data type.
Options E and F will not work without an explicit cast to a smaller data type.
