/*
Which of the following are true? (Choose all that apply)

A. A local variable of type boolean defaults to null.
B. A local variable of type float defaults to 0.
C. A local variable of type Object defaults to null.
D. A local variable of type boolean defaults to false.
E. A local variable of type boolean defaults to true.
F. A local variable of type float defaults to 0.0.
G. None of the above.

G. Option G is correct because local variables do not get assigned default values. The
code fails to compile if a local variable is not explicitly initialized. If this question
were about instance variables, options D and F would be correct. A boolean primitive
defaults to false and a float primitive defaults to 0.0 .
