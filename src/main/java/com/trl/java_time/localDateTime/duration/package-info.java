/**
 * Important thinq to remember here is that Period is used to manipulate dates in terms of days, months, and years,
 * while Duration is used to manipulate dates in terms of hours, minutes, and seconds. Therefore, Period doesn't mess
 * with the time component of the date while Duration may change the time component if the date is close to the DST boundary.
 *
 * Durations and periods differ in their treatment of daylight savings time when added to ZonedDateTime. A Duration will
 * add an exact number of seconds, thus a duration of one day is always exactly 24 hours. By contrast, a Period will add
 * a conceptual day, trying to maintain the local time.
 *
 * For example, consider adding a period of one day and a duration of one day to 18:00 on the evening before a daylight
 * savings gap. The Period will add the conceptual day and result in a ZonedDateTime at 18:00 the following day.
 * By contrast, the Duration will add exactly 24 hours, resulting in a ZonedDateTime at 19:00 the following
 * day (assuming a one hour DST gap).
 *
 * A Duration of one day is exactly 24 hours long. A Period of one day, when added to a ZonedDateTime, may vary
 * according to the time zone. For example, if it occurs on the first or last day of daylight saving time.
