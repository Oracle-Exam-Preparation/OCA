/*
Which of the following can fill in the blank in this code to make it compile? (Choose all that apply)

public class Ant {
_____ void method() { }
}

A. default
B. final
C. private
D. Public
E. String
F. zzz:

B, C. void is a return type. Only the access modifier or optional specifiers are allowed before the return type. Option
C is correct, creating a method with private access. Option B is correct, creating a method with default access and the
optional specifier final. Since default access does not require a modifier, we get to jump right to final. Option A is
incorrect because default access omits the access modifier rather than specifying default. Option D is incorrect because
Java is case sensitive. It would have been correct if public were the choice. Option E is incorrect because the method
already has a void return type. Option F is incorrect because labels are not allowed for methods.
