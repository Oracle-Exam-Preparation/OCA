/*
Which of the following Java operators can be used with boolean variables? (Choose all that apply)

A. ==
B. +
C. --
D. !
E. %
F. <=

A, D. Option A is the equality operator and can be used on numeric primitives, boolean values, and object references.
Options B and C are both arithmetic operators and cannot be applied to a boolean value. Option D is the logical complement
operator and is used exclusively with boolean values. Option E is the modulus operator, which can only be used with
numeric primitives. Finally, option F is a relational operator that compares the values of two numbers.
