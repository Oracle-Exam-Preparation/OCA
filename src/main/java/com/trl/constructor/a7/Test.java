Which of these classes compile and use a default constructor? (Choose all that apply)
A. public class Bird { }
B. public class Bird { public bird() {} }
C. public class Bird { public bird(String name) {} }
D. public class Bird { public Bird() {} }
E. public class Bird { Bird(String name) {} }
F. public class Bird { private Bird(int age) {} }
G. public class Bird { void Bird() { }

A, G. Options B and C don’t compile because the constructor name must match the classname. Since Java is case sensitive,
these don’t match. Options D, E, and F all compile and provide one user-defined constructor. Since a constructor is coded,
a default constructor isn’t supplied. Option G defines a method, but not a constructor. Option A does not define a
constructor, either. Since no constructor is coded, a default constructor is provided for options A and G.
