Which exception will the following throw?

Object obj = new Integer(3);
String str = (String) obj;
System.out.println(str);

A. ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
B. ClassCastException
C. IllegalArgumentException
D. NumberFormatException
E. None of the above.

B. The second line tries to cast an Integer to a String. Since String does not extend Integer, this is not allowed and a
ClassCastException is thrown.
