/*
Which scenario is the best use of an exception?

A. An element is not found when searching a list.
B. An unexpected parameter is passed into a method.
C. The computer caught fire.
D. You want to loop through a list.
E. You don’t know how to code a method.

B. IllegalArgumentException is used when an unexpected parameter is passed into a method. Option A is incorrect because
returning null or -1 is a common return value for this scenario. Option D is incorrect because a for loop is typically
used for this scenario. Option E is incorrect because you should find out how to code the method and not leave it for the
unsuspecting programmer who calls your method. Option C is incorrect because you should run!
