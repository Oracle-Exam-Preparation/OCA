/*
Which of the following are checked exceptions? (Choose all that apply)

A. Exception
B. IllegalArgumentException
C. IOException
D. NullPointerException
E. NumberFormatException
F. StackOverflowError

A, C. Option A is the exception base class, which is a checked exception. Options B, D, and E extend RuntimeException
directly or indirectly and therefore are unchecked exceptions. Option F is a throwable and not an exception, and so
should not be caught or declared.
