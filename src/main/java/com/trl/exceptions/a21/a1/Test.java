Which of the following can be inserted into Lion to make this code compile? (Choose all that apply)

class HasSoreThroatException extends Exception {}
class TiredException extends RuntimeException {}
interface Roar { void roar() throws HasSoreThroatException; }
class Lion implements Roar { // INSERT CODE HERE }

A. public void roar(){}
B. public void roar() throws Exception{}
C. public void roar() throws HasSoreThroatException{}
D. public void roar() throws IllegalArgumentException{}
E. public void roar() throws TiredException{}

A, C, D, E. The method is allowed to throw no exceptions at all, making option A correct. It is also allowed to throw
runtime exceptions, making options D and E correct. Option C is also correct since it matches the signature in the interface.
