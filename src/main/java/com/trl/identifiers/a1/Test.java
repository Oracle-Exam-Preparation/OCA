/*
Which of the following are valid Java identifiers? (Choose all that apply)

A. A$B
B. _helloWorld
C. true
D. java.lang
E. Public
F. 1980_s

1. A, B, E. Option A is valid because you can use the dollar sign in identifiers. Option B is valid because you can use
an underscore in identifiers. Option C is not a valid identifier because true is a Java reserved word. Option D is not
valid because the dot (.) is not allowed in identifiers. Option E is valid because Java is case sensitive, so Public is
not a reserved word and therefore a valid identifier. Option F is not valid because the first character is not
a letter, $, or _.
