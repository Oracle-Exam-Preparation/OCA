/*
What modifiers are assumed for all interface variables? (Choose all that apply)

A. public
B. protected
C. private
D. static
E. final
F. abstract

A, D, E. Interface variables are assumed to be public static final ; therefore, options A, D, and E are correct.
Options B and C are incorrect because interface variables must be public—interfaces are implemented by classes, not
inherited by interfaces. Option F is incorrect because variables can never be abstract.
